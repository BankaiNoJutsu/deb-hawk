  # If you ever read this, o unhappy one, I'm not injecting controller data
  # into my models, but I *do* need the current user when models invoke
  # external commands to update the cluster configuration (this is required
  # for ACLs to work properly in this application, which has nothing to do
  # with Rails at all), and I'm damn well not passing the current user to
  # every model, when the models themselves actually don't need to care who
  # is using them.
