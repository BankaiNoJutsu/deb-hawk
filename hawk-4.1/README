HA Web Konsole (Hawk)
=====================
Tim Serong <tserong@novell.com>


== Overview ==

Hawk is a web-based GUI for managing and monitoring Pacemaker HA
clusters.  It is generally intended to be run on every node in the
cluster, so that you can just point your web browser at any node
to access it, e.g.:

https://your-server:7630/

Hawk requires users to log in prior to providing access to the
cluster.  The same rules apply as for the python GUI; you need to
log in as a user in the +haclient+ group.  The easiest thing to do
is assign a password to the +hacluster+ user, then log in using
that account.  Note that you will need to configure this user
account on every node you want to use Hawk on.

Once logged in, you will see the currently configured nodes and
resources in expandable panels, much like the +crm_mon+ display.
The panels will be collapsed by default, unless any resource or
node is stopped or failed, in which case they will automatically
expand.

Management operations (start, stop, online, standby, etc.) can be
performed by clicking the little menu icon to the right of any
node or resource.  New resources can be created using the top level
menu on the Resources panel.  crm_config options can be changed
by clicking the icon in the Cluster Configuration panel.


== Installation ==

=== Dependencies ===

Hawk is a Ruby on Rails app which runs from a standalone instance
of lighttpd.  All required Ruby gems are frozen into the Hawk package
at build time.  Its runtime dependencies are thus:

* pacemaker
* lighttpd
* ruby

When building Hawk from source, you will also need:

* rubygems
* rubygem-rake
* rubygem-rails >= 2.3
* rubygem-gettext_rails
* ruby-fcgi (openSUSE/SLES only)
* fdupes (openSUSE/SLES only)
* pam-devel
* glib2-devel
* libxml2-devel
* libpacemaker-devel (openSUSE/SLES)
* pacemaker-libs-devel (Fedora)


=== Installing The Easy Way ===

Hawk is included with SLE HAE 11 SP1 and openSUSE 11.4. Just
install the RPM, then run:

--------------------------------------
# chkconfig hawk on
# rchawk start
--------------------------------------


=== Installing The Other Easy Way ===

If you have a recent SUSE- or Fedora-based system, you can build
an RPM easily from the source tree:

--------------------------------------
# hg clone http://hg.clusterlabs.org/pacemaker/hawk
# cd hawk
# hg update tip
# make rpm
--------------------------------------

Then install the RPM on your cluster nodes and:

--------------------------------------
# chkconfig hawk on
# /etc/init.d/hawk start
--------------------------------------


=== The Hard Way ===

If the above RPM build doesn't work for you, you can build and install
straight from the source tree, but _read the Makefile first_ to ensure
you'll be happy with the outcome.

--------------------------------------
# hg clone http://hg.clusterlabs.org/pacemaker/hawk
# cd hawk
# hg update tip
# make
# sudo make install
--------------------------------------

The above will install in +/srv/www/hawk+ and run from a SUSE-style init
script.  To install somewhere else (e.g.: +/var/www/hawk+) and/or to
use a Red Hat-style init script, try:

--------------------------------------
# make WWW_BASE=/var/www INIT_STYLE=redhat
# sudo make WWW_BASE=/var/www INIT_STYLE=redhat install
--------------------------------------


== A Note on SSL Certificates ==

The Hawk init script will automatically generate a self-signed SSL
certificate, in +/etc/lighttpd/certs/hawk-combined.pem+.  If you want
to use your own certificate, simply replace this file with one of
your creation.  Note that this is a combined key and certificate, i.e.
you'll need to +cat key cert > hawk-combined.pem+.


== Hacking Hawk ==

Hacking an instance of Hawk that was installed from an RPM is annoying,
not least because you have to keep restarting it to have any changed
files reloaded.  Instead, it's easiest to just run it under WEBrick
from within the source tree, but first you need to run +make+ to build
the +hawk_chkpwd+ and +hawk_invoke+ helper binaries, then install them
setuid-root, group=haclient in /usr/sbin.  You should end up with
something like:

--------------------------------------
# ls /usr/sbin/hawk_* -l
-rwsr-x--- 1 root haclient 9884 2011-04-14 22:56 /usr/sbin/hawk_chkpwd
-rwsr-x--- 1 root haclient 9928 2011-04-14 22:56 /usr/sbin/hawk_invoke
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root     9992 2011-04-14 22:56 /usr/sbin/hawk_monitor
--------------------------------------

+hawk_chkpwd+ is almost identical to +unix2_chkpwd+, except it restricts
acccess to users in the +haclient+ group, and doesn't inject any delay
when invoked by the +hacluster+ user (which is the user Hawk's lighttpd
instance runs as).

+hawk_invoke+ allows the +hacluster+ user to run a small assortment
of Pacemaker CLI tools as another user in order to support Pacemaker's
ACL feature.  It is used by Hawk when performing various management
tasks.

+hawk_monitor+ is not installed setuid-root.  It exists to be polled
by the web browser, to facilitate near-realtime updates of the cluster
status display.  It is not used when running Hawk via WEBrick.

Once you've got the above built and installed, run:

--------------------------------------
# sudo -u hacluster hawk/script/server
--------------------------------------

This will give you Hawk running via HTTP (_not_ HTTPS), on port 3000,
e.g.:

http://your-dev-system:3000/

Note that automatic status updates won't work in this mode, because
requests for +/monitor+ aren't routed to +/usr/sbin/hawk_monitor+.
To force a status update every few seconds, try:

http://your-dev-system:3000/main/status?update_period=5

Finally, an alternative to running WEBrick as hacluster (which may
require fiddling with file permissions in your source directory,
depending on how restrictive your defaults are), you can just rsync
the source tree to a development cluster node, then and run it as
root there.
