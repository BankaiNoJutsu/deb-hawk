Description: HA Web Konsole (Hawk) is a web-based GUI for Pacemaker HA clusters.
 Hawk (HA Web Konsole) is a web-based GUI for Pacemaker
 HA clusters. It offers status monitoring, starting,
 stopping and moving of resources, changing node status
 as well as resource and cluster configuration.
 This package contains "frozen" RubyGems  just like the
 upstream version. Runtime dependencies are therefore
 minimal, but security updates for the gems will NOT
 come from the Debian repos.
